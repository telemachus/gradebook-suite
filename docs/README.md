# gradebook-suite

This repository contains command line tools to help me manage student grades.

## Warning

Everything here is very beta.
You probably do not want to use these tools, and you are not me.

## Tools

See `internal/cli/usage.go` for more details, but tl;dr, here are the tools.

+ `gradebook-calc`: calculate and print grades
+ `gradebook-emails`: print the emails of students
+ `gradebook-names`: print the names of students
+ `gradebook-new`: create a new gradebook file
+ `gradebook-unscored`: print counts of unscored assignments
